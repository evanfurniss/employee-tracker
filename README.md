## Description

The employee tracker is an app created to manage employees based on certain parameters such as department, job title, salary, manager, and more. The employee tracker helps maintain all workers parameters and update that information as employees come and go in the work place.

Using the command prompt, switch statements, MySQL database management, I was able to navigate prompts to pull information from the datasets and present it to the user in an easy to read table. The option to add a department, role, or new employee will pull existing data from the tables to add with the created departement, role, or id.
